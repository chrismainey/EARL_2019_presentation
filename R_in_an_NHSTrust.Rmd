# Introduction

---

## University Hospitals Birmingham NHS FT 

- Second largest Acute-Hospital Trust 
- Formed by merger of former UHB and Heart of England trusts
- Four hospitals seeing 440,000 in-patients per year

--

<br>
- Large informatics team(s):
 - Core Information
 - SQL / Dashboard developers
 - Analytics
 - Research 
 - Commercial

---

## Benchmarking Platforms

###Healthcare Evaluation Data (HED)
[www.hed.nhs.uk](www.hed.nhs.uk)


- Online hospital benchmarking system
- Statistical models and analysis tools
- Training and support
- Used by ~60 NHS and other organisations


---

## Data analysis tools in the NHS


- Excel and Access were baseline 10-years ago
- 'Complicated' Database work conducted by IT department

- Some Trusts sent regular extracts from system suppliers

- Increasing use of Qlik, PowerBI and Tableau recently

--


### UHB:

- Recruited SQL developers and slowly moved department to SQL Server
- Excel, SQL Server Reporting Services and TIBCO Spotfire used for outputs

---

## Keenies...

.pull-left[

- `R` was used only for rare 'statistical' calculations

- A few keen medical student or researchers

- Conserved pattern at other Trusts

- The case in our team...

# Allowed space to develop skills:

- My own PhD project, funded by UHB, on statistical modelling in NHS.
- Chose to use `R` from the outset, rather than SAS or Stata.

--

- Python is good candidate too, but harder to find training when I started
- Developed statistical, visualisation and data manipulation skills

--

- Moved some HED models to `R`
- Supported other team members to use it
- This generated a demand for basic training

---
# Followed established patterns:

- Set up a local user group

--

- Trained senior team
 
--

- Encouraged new starters to use it
 - Plan work that requires it

--

- External relationships:
 - Twitter has been key
 - NHS-R Community: https://nhsrcommunity.com/
 - External R user groups
 - Regional relationships: Other Trusts, PHE, City Council
 - Advice from Mango, RStudio and others

---

# Barriers

- __Open Source fears:__ IT teams sometimes reluctant to install
--

- __Wrestling with default settings:__
 - Mapped user folder that aren't writable
 - Can't write to package library, or temp files
--

- __Poor hardware__
 - Mostly desktop users at hospitals
 - Defaults can be low on disk space with minimal RAM
--
 
- __Lack of understanding of fundamentals:__
 - Networking/file locations
 - Suspicions around security
 - `R` coding or application to problems
 
---

# Solutions

- __Permissions:__  ___Explicitly identify default settings___
--

 - Set a specific library, using `R_libs_user` variable

 - Set temporary directories using `.Renviron` file

--

- __Hardware:__ 
 - Make the case for more RAM! It doesn't cost much
 - Consider server approaches: VMs or 'Desktop' on a 'Server'
 - RStudio Server / RStudio Connect
--

- __Skill/Awareness:__
 - Allow space to develop knowledge
  - Windows users often don't know file paths, SSH etc.
  - Central guidance on R/Python implementation
---

# How do we use it?

1. Regression, and related models (`mgcv`, `lme4`, `glmmTMB`, `glmnet`)
1. Machine Learning technique (`caret`, `randomForest`, `gbm`)
1. Optimisation problems (solving equations using `nloptr`)
1. Summary stats and Exploration
1. `RMarkdown` Reports and Presentation
1. API interaction (NHS ODS service, CQC register organisations)

# Initial adoption:



.pull-left[

<img src= './assets/script.png' width=110% height=120%>

]
.pull-right[
- Collections of `R` scripts saved to directory
 - Required lead analyst to write
 - Required team skills to run and/or debug

- Constant debugging:
 - Data changing
 - Littered with comment, hard to decipher
 
]
---

# Creating a local package

Wrapped functions in to an `R` package structure

- Built binary and save to file structure
--

- Use `roxygen2` to write your support material as you define functions

# Source control 

.pull-left[
- Moved to source control
 - Install git for windows 
 - Git learning curve
 - Happy Git with `R`! https://happygitwithr.com/ 
 ]
 
.pull-right[
 - Git repo on TFS
 - Figure out https connections
 - Stef Locke's `tfsr` https://github.com/lockedata/tfsR 
]

# NHS-R community

.pull-left[
- Funded by grant from the Health Foundation
- Aimed to support and promote `R` use
- Training provision
- Blog posts
- Discussion and dissemination of best practice
- Development of tools
- National Conference
]

.pull-right[
<img src= './assets/nhsr-logo.png' width=100% height=100%>

# What's next?

- Continuing to develop analyst skills in `R`
- Contributing to, or building Open Source tools with NHS-R community
  - __FunnelPlotR:__ https://github.com/chrismainey/FunnelPlotR
  - __NHSRdatasets:__ https://github.com/nhs-r-community/NHSRdatasets
- Wider adoption of Git/GitHub
- Pushing further into ML techniques for prediction
  - Improving current models: Ensemble techniques etc.
  - Unsupervised techniques for cluster analysis
