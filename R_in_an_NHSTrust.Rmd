# Introduction

---

### University Hospitals Birmingham NHS FT 

- Second largest Acute-Hospital Trust 
- Formed by merger of former UHB and Heart of England trusts
- Four hospitals seeing xxxx patients per year

--

- Large informatics team(s):
 - Core Information
 - SQL / Dashboard developers
 - Analytics
 - Research Team
 - Commercial

---

## What is 'Commercial' in the NHS?

- Healthcare Evaluation Data (HED)
 - Online hospital benchmarking system
 - Based on Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), national data over several years
 - Statistical models and analysis
 - Training and support
 - Used by ~60 NHS and other organisations


- Other .Net-based web tools for Genomics
- NORSE

---

## Data analysis tools in NHS and UHB, used

__`R` is not prevalent__
--

- Excel and Access were base-line 10-years ago
- Complicated Database work conducted by `IT`
- Some Trusts sent regular extracts from system supplier
- Recruited SQL developers and slowly move whole department to SQL Server
- Excel, SQL Server Reporting Services and TIBCO Spotfire used for outputs

--

<br>
__`R` was used only for rare 'statistical' calculations or by the 'keenies.'__

- Conserved pattern at other Trusts, handful of keen users can make the change...

# Allow space to develop skills:

- My own PhD project, funded by UHB, on statistical modelling in NHS.
- Chose to use `R` from the outset, rather than SAS or Stata
- Python is good candidate too, but harder to find training when I started
- Developed statistical, visualisation and data manipulation skills

- Moved some HED models to `R`
- Supported other team members to use it
- This generated a demand for basic training

---
# Follow established patterns:

- Set up a local user group
- Trained senior team
- Encouraged new starters to use it
- Made a big fuss about how awesome  is!
--

- External relationships:
 - Twitter has been key
 - NHS-R Community: https://nhsrcommunity.com/
 - External R user groups
 - Regional relationships: Other Trusts, PHE, City Council
 - Advice from Mango, RStudio and others

---

# Barriers

- __Open Source fears:__ IT teams sometime reluctant to install
--

- __Wrestling with default settings:__
 - Mapped user folder that aren't writeable
 - Can't write to package library, or temp files
--

- __Poor hardware__
 - Mostly desktop users at hospitals
 - Defaults can be low on disk space with minimal RAM
--
 
- __Lack of understanding of fundamentals:__
 - Networking/file locations
 - Suspicions around security
 - `R` coding or application to problems
 
---

# Solutions

- __Permissions:__  ___Explicitly identify default settings___
--

 - Set a specific library folder, using Windows Environmental variable `R_libs_user`

 - Set temporary directories using `.Renviron` file

--

- __Hardware:__ 
 - Make the case for more RAM! It doesn't cost much
 - Consider server approaches: VMs or 'Desktop' on a 'Server'
 - RStudio Server / RStudio Connect
--

- __Skill/Awareness:__
 - Allow space to develop knowledge
  - Window paradigm can mean people don't know file paths, SSH etc.
  - Central guidance on R/Python implementation
---

# How do we use it?

1. Regression, and related models (`mgcv`, `lme4`, `glmmTMB`, `glmnet`)
1. Machine Learning technique (`caret`, `randomForest`, `gbm`)
1. Optimisation problems (solving equations using `nloptr`)
1. Summary stats and Exploration
1. `RMarkdown` Reports and Presentation
1. API interaction (NHS ODS service, CQC register organisations)

# Initial adoption:



.pull-left[

<img src= './assets/script.png' width=110% height=120%>

]
.pull-right[
- Collections of `R` scripts save to directory
 - Required lead analyst to write
 - Required team skills to run and/or debug

- Constant debugging:
 - Data changing
 - Littered with comment, hard to decipher
 
]
---

# Creating a local package

Wrapped functions in to local package structure

- Initially on one machine
 - Built binary and save to file structure
--

- Use `roxygen2` to write your support material as you define functions

# Source control 

.pull-left[
- Moved to source control
 - Install git for windows 
 - Git learning curve
 - Happy Git with `R`! https://happygitwithr.com/ 
 ]
 
.pull-right[
 - Git repo on TFS
 - Figure out https connections
 - Stef Locke's `tfsr` https://github.com/lockedata/tfsR

# NHS-R community

.pull-left[
- Funded by grant from the Health Foundation
- Aimed to support and promote `R` use
- Training provision
- Blog posts
- Discussion and dissemination of best practise
- Development of tools
]

.pull-right[

# What's next?

- Continuing to develop analyst skills in `R`
- Contributing to, or building Open Source tools with NHS-R community
- Wider adoption of Git/GitHub
- Pushing further into ML techniques for prediction


## Thanks you for your time.
