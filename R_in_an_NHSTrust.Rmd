# Introduction

---

## University Hospitals Birmingham 
## NHS Foundation Trust 

- Second largest Acute-Hospital Trust 
- Formed by merger of former UHB and Heart of England trusts
- Fours hospitals seeing xxxx patients per year

--

- Large informatics team(s):
 - Core Information
 - SQL / Dashboard developers
 - Analytics
 - Research Team
 - Commercial

---

# What is 'Commerical' in NHS?

- Healthcare Evaluation Data (HED)
 - Online hospital benchmarking system
 - Based on Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), national data over several years
 - Statistical models and analysis
 - Training and support
 - Used by ~60 NHS and other organsiations


- Other .Net-based web tools for Genomics
- NORSE

# Data analysis tools in NHS and UHB, used

`R` is not prevalent

- Excel and Access were base-line 10-years ago
- Complicated Database work conducted by `IT`
- Some Trusts sent regular extracts from system supplier
- Recruited SQL developers and slowly move whole department to SQL Server
- Excel, SQL Reporting Services and TIBCO Spotfire used for outputs

`R` was used only for rare 'statistical' calculations or 'keenies.'

- Conserved pattern at other Trusts, one keen user can make the change...

---
# One keen user:

- My own PhD project, funded by UHB, on staitstical modelling in NHS.
- Chose to use `R` from the outset, rather than SAS or Stata
- Python is good candidate too, but harder to find training when I started
- Developed statistical, visualisation and data manipulation skills

- Moved some HED models to `R`
- Support other team members to use it
- This generated a demand for basic training.

---
# Follow established patterns;

- Set up a local user group
- Trained senior team
- Encourgaged new starters to use it
- Made a big fuss about how awesome  is!

- External relationships:
 - Twitter has been key
 - NHS-R Community
 - External R user groups
 - Regional relationships: Othe Trusts, PHE, City Council
 - Advice from Mango, RStudio and others

---

# Barrriers

- Open Source fears: IT teams sometime relucant to install open source software
- Wrestling with default settings:
 - Many NHS networks have default mapped user folder that aren't writeable
 - Can't write to package library, or default file locations
 
- Lack of understanding of fundamentals:
 - Networking/file locations
 - Security
 - `R` coding or application

# How do we use it?

1. Regression, and related models (`mgcv`, `lme4`, `glmmTMB`, `glmnet`)
1. Optimisation problems (solving equations using `nloptr`)
1. Summary stats and Exploration
1. `RMarkdown` Reports and Presentation
1. API interaction (NHS ODS service, CQC register organsiations)

---
# NHS R-community

- Funded by grant from the Health Foundation


---

# What's next?

- Continuing to develop analyst skills in `R`
- Contirbuting to , or building Open Source tools
- Wider adoption of Git/GitHub
