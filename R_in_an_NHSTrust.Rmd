# Data analysis tools used

`R` is not prevalent

- Excel and Access were base-line 10-years ago
- Complicated Database work conducted by `IT`
- Recruited SQL developers and slowly move whole department to SQL Server
- Excel, SQL Reporting Services and TIBCO Spotfire used for outputs

`R` was used only for rare statistical calcualtions
